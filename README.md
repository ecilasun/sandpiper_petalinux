# About Sandpiper

Sandpiper is an interesting machine. It is a linux based small computer based around a Zynq 7020 SoC, with custom video and audio circuitry programmed into the FPGA fabric. A specialzed device driver allows access to a shared memory region and some control registers to control these video and audio devices.

An SDK is provided alongside the PCB for the keyboard module and enclosure files for 3D printing, as well as the build files for Linux kernel and drivers in the following repositories:
